        		<h1>What I've Done</h1>
            			<p>Over the past few years I’ve been lucky enough to be involved in some exciting organizations and teams. It’s difficult to convey the full story of anything on a resume, so here is a little more on some of the meaningful opportunities I’ve been a part of, and why they were so great. For a full list of my academic and professional endeavors, check out my resume <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IwXwY3gTiHGpUf1ovC5Y_kb5Onw_U9J0/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			<h2>Senior Capstone: Algorithmic Bias Research</h2>
				<p>While this project is still in progress, it is one that I have been working towards for the past four years of my undergraduate career. With the help of my thesis advisor, Jennifer Stromer-Galley, I have chosen to narrow my focus on algorithmic bias. I have joined the Illuminating Project, an iSchool-based research team that is looking at social media and its influence in political elections, as a data ethicist. I plan to look at the algorithms and coding in the Illuminating project critically, as a case study to discuss algorithmic bias and its impact and importance in general. I have been lucky to be able to pursue research on this topic in the NEXIS lab, a student-run technology lab based in the iSchool. Through NEXIS, I have gained backing and support from the iSchool, professors, and other student research teams. I initially became passionate about the importance of data ethics after taking a course with Professor Stromer-Galley, where I learned how influential algorithms are in the human experience. We talked about algorithmic bias in loan distributions, political targeting, redlining and in predictive policing, and how all of these data-based assessments about humans can be harmful, particularly to groups that are already marginalized in society. My hope is to produce a report that emphasizes the need for data ethicists on every team or project that is using artificial intelligence.</p>
			<h2>Community Geography Intern</h2>
				<p>I worked remotely for the Syracuse University Geography department, in conjunction with the City of Syracuse. As a research intern, my goal was to assist Syracuse University in its endeavor of helping the city of Syracuse appropriate grant funding in becoming the flagship smart city of New York. I worked to understand how smart cities are utilizing information technologies like IoT, GIS, AI, 5G, machine learning, and other forms of technology to become more sustainable, citizen-oriented, and connected. I then produced reports on how smart cities can use technology in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic to both mitigate issues and prevent future outbreaks. I built a framework of potential smart solutions for public administrators in Syracuse to use at the local, state, and federal level, as well as solutions for private companies and citizens. Using my expertise and knowledge of technology, I built reports explaining how advanced technology could be implemented, how they work, what risks and costs are associated with them, and potential adoption timelines. This role was so important to me because one day I hope to use technology in real-world applications professionally. It was great to get some experience working as a mediator between technology and policy, and I have always hoped to one day work in these two spheres. As smart cities become more commonplace, I believe that technology and data science fields can make cities more livable and mitigate systemic or widespread issues. I plan to submit my research report to academic journals in the future.</p>
			<h2>Honors Freshman Seminar Leader</h2>
				<p>I volunteered approximately 60 hours of time as a teacher’s assistant for first year students in the Syracuse University honors program. Freshman forum is designed specifically for honors students to both have an introduction to campus, and a safe space to openly discuss what it means to be a new member of a larger student body. I served as both a peer mentor, and lesson organizer. Our goal was to create a dialogue on topics like health, wellness, diversity and inclusion on a college campus. Fostering community virtually was particularly significant during a pandemic and tumultuous times in America, where many freshmen were feeling isolated and confused. We focused on making our time a safe space, cultivating friendships, and becoming familiar with the honors program, Syracuse University, the city of Syracuse, and the Onondaga Nation whose land we live on. </p>
			<h2>UNICEF Executive Board</h2>
				<p>As Community Service Chair at the Syracuse University UNICEF chapter, I served as a liaison between the international organization UNICEF, the Syracuse University student body, and the larger community of Syracuse, NY. Syracuse university students often exist in a metaphorical bubble of campus and the surrounding areas, which is physically segregated from the city and its people by Interstate 84. With ongoing debate in the Syracuse community on removing the highway, and assimilating the two distinct Syracuse communities, I found this role to be extremely relevant to the current politics. Many students at Syracuse don’t pay much attention to the larger City of Syracuse. Syracuse is a city rich with history, that has been struck with economic hardship, but has loyal supporters behind it working to bring the city back to its prime. The best part about this role was getting to meet and work with some of these people passionate about Syracuse, working at non-profits and other organizations to help the people of Syracuse. Most notably, we volunteered weekly at RISE (Refugee and Immigrant Self-Empowerment), an organization that hosts education, child-care, translation services, and other programs for the growing refugee and immigrant population in Syracuse. We also collected donations from SU students for Vera House, an organization that supports survivors of domestic and/or sexual abuse. I also organized partnerships with on campus groups and professional fraternities to join forces in fundraising or promoting awareness of other causes in Syracuse and beyond. The Syracuse student body is generally really invigorated by the prospect of volunteering, but many don’t know where or how to start. This position taught me how to grow into my own right as a leader on campus, and that I can help make a small, but real change in my community.</p>
			<h2>Information Technology Intern</h2>
				<p>I worked at the global headquarters of Xylem Inc. in the IT department the summer before my junior year, and in the winter of my junior year. Xylem is a water technology and solutions company, and while their area of focus is a little different from mine, I learned so much about corporate culture, IT, and even water solutions while I was there. I had a really great relationship with my managers, Debbie Sadr and Michael McLaughlin, who gave me both technical and career advice. I learned a lot, mostly because Debbie and Michael placed a lot of trust in me to work on projects on my own. After my study abroad program left me at home with a few months of free time, I asked if they had any space in the office to return for a little and work independently on some projects. They both knew that I was a very independent worker, and thus they wouldn’t have to allocate too much time to working with me, so I was able to return for a few more months. Beyond learning to work in a large, hierarchical company, I learned a lot about being flexible and resourceful in my position. I began in IT, fixing technical problems for 17,000+ employees around the world, but I ended up working with systems administrators in Sweden, smart city researchers in India, and the communications team in Rye Brook. I found that my technological expertise could be utilized, and I could bring fresh new ideas to the company. I helped onboard a new internal communications software through Facebook software, which employees could use for work-tased projects and teams, as well as building company culture in creating more leisure-based groups. Xylem is a large, international company, with people working industry-based construction jobs, and corporate positions, so we found people responding really well to getting to have a place where they could share what they do and have channels to communicate. I was also invited to a Facebook conference with my team in New York City, where we could learn how to better utilize the communication software we used, and network with other companies using the same software. I helped the company get outfitted for live-streaming events, and got to work directly with the CEO and CFO. We put on multiple live town hall meetings and live stream events where company leaders could communicate to all colleagues in a professional manner. </p>
			<h2>Manager and Salesperson</h2>
				<p>Often times I don’t include my jobs in the service industry on job applications. However, I find the lessons learned in these roles taught me more about interpersonal skills than I ever could have asked for. Thus, I find them relevant to mention as the backbone of my professional skills. I worked at Turkey Ridge, a jewelry boutique and gift store for around 5 years. I began just tidying the store with no real expertise, and left as an assistant manager, helping the owner purchase and price new items with each coming season, displaying items, training new employees, and opening and closing the store on my own. My boss, Nadine, taught me how to earn responsibility through hard work, and the value of resourceful quick-thinking. Nadine was a tough boss at times, but I am so thankful for that. She was very particular, and ran a tight ship, but rewarded good work with raises and bonuses. Nadine expected us to know what she wanted before she asked for it and would never repeat an instruction twice. While the environment at times felt cut-throat (which seems dramatic for a boutique, but it did get really crazy around the holidays), I was pushed to be professional and friendly, resourceful and quick, even-tempered and independent. When you are a 14-year-old being yelled at by 50-year-old women because you won’t accept returns, you learn valuable lessons about staying cool under pressure. After all of these years, I respect Nadine as a powerful role-model both in business knowledge, and in confidence and poise. I visit the store as often as I can, and we email back and forth as I update her on the changes in my life.</p>
			<h1>How I Work</h1>
				<p>While I often work in groups, I do my best work self-directed. My ideal style of completing a project is one where teams brainstorm individually and regroup to collaborate at critical times. I believe that my productivity level is highest alone, but I am most creative and invigorated when working in a group.</p>
				<p>Over my college years, some of the hardest, and best lessons I learned were about how to develop interpersonal skills. The times I have failed were the ones where I didn’t fully lean on my group members, and would try to take over the entire project, resulting in undeserving resentment towards my group, and lower quality work . Thus, as I grow up and mature, I learn to be a leader, but not an overbearing boss. Over my past four years at Syracuse, I have also learned the value in time management. I love my free time as much as the next person, and I have truly learned the hard way that procrastinating is not the way to enjoy your free time. Today, I find it easy to balance work and play by keeping lists, an organized planner, and prioritizing by deadlines. I entered college very unorganized, and would often forget small assignments, or just feel overwhelmed with everything I had to do. Now, I consider myself hyper-organized, and have seen my stress levels decrease, even as my workload and responsibilities increase.</p>
