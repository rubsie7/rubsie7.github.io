        		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I’m currently a senior at the Syracuse University School of Information Studies, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Management & Technology, and a Master of Science in Applied Data Science. Upon receiving my bachelor’s degree in May 2021, I plan to finish my master’s degree online in one year, while working full time.</p>
			<p>I am an aspiring coffee connoisseur, frequent movie-goer, and podcast aficionado. In my free time I’m reading, singing on long walks, journaling positive affirmations, or making playlists for extremely specific moments. I’m passionate about living sustainably and avoiding fast fashion, learning new things, and fostering creativity and curiosity in my everyday life.</p>
          		<p>I believe in utilizing technology for positive change, through understanding its pitfalls. I am confident in the potentials of technology, particularly in making our cities more sustainable. However, I am equally as confident in the potential for harm that these technologies bring. I hope to look at connected technology and algorithms that interact with people through a critical lens, in order to mitigate security risks or discriminatory outputs. I believe that with ethical guidelines in data science, real change can occur to target systemic environmental and human rights issues. I am currently working on my senior capstone on avoiding algorithmic bias through AI ethics.</p>
			<p>I also believe in listening to understand, not to respond. I believe in empathy in technology, business, politics, and everyday life. I believe in the power of placing hope in our future. I also believe that movies are always better when watched at a movie theatre, and that plant-based milk should cost less than dairy milk.</p>
